## Overview
FIX is a benchmark for **extracting features that are interpretable to real-world experts**, spanning diverse data modalities and applications, from doctors performing gall bladder surgery to cosmologists studying supernovae. The FIX benchmark allows domains to measure alignment of extracted features with expert features either *implicitly* with a scoring function or *explicitly* with expert annotations.

The FIX package contains:

 * Data loaders that automatically handle data downloading, processing, and splitting, and
 * Dataset evaluators that standardize model evaluation for each dataset.

In addition, we include an example script that runs all baselines for every setting.

<!-- For more information, please visit [our website](https://brachiolab.github.io/fix/) or read the main FIX [paper](https://github.com/BrachioLab/brachiolab.github.io/blob/live/fix/jin2024fix.pdf). -->
<!-- For questions and feedback, please post on the [discussion board](https://github.com/BrachioLab/exlib/discussions). -->

## Getting Started
### Installation
To use FIX, you must first install the exlib package (which has a separate README outside this FIX folder), as follows:
```
pip install exlib
```

If you have exlib already installed, please check that you have the latest version:
```
python -c "import exlib; print(exlib.__version__)"
# This should print "0.0.2". If it does not, update the package by running:
pip install -U exlib
```

### FIX Notebooks
Tutorial notebooks for each FIX setting are located in the [../notebooks/fix](https://github.com/BrachioLab/exlib/blob/master/notebooks/fix) folder.
The main dependencies needed to run them are all installed in exlib or alternatively you can use our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/BrachioLab/dockerfiles/blob/main/riceric22/exlib/Dockerfile).

### FIX Baselines
To run all baselines for every dataset setting, you can run the following script:
```
./run_fix_baselines.sh
```
The baseline feature extractors for differenet data modalities (e.g. text, time series, data) are located in the [../src/exlib/features](https://github.com/BrachioLab/exlib/blob/master/src/features) folder.

## Datasets
FIX currently includes 6 datasets, which we've briefly listed below. All datasets and models are hosted on Huggingface (see links in table). For full dataset descriptions, please see our [paper](https://github.com/BrachioLab/brachiolab.github.io/blob/live/fix/jin2024fix.pdf).
