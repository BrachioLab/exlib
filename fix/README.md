## Overview
FIX is a benchmark for extracting features that are interpretable to real-world experts, spanning diverse data modalities and applications, from doctors performing gall bladder surgery to cosmologists studying supernovae.


For more information, please visit [our website](https://brachiolab.github.io/fix/) or read the main FIX paper ().
For questions and feedback, please post on the [discussion board](https://github.com/exlib/discussions).

## Getting Started
Tutorial notebooks for each FIX setting are located in the notebooks/fix folder.
The main dependencies needed to run them are all installed in exlib or alternatively you can use our [Dockerfile]().
